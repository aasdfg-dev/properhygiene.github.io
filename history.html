	<br>The word hygiene comes from Hygeia, the Greek goddess of health, <br>
	who was the daughter of Aesculapius, the god of medicine. <br>
	Since the arrival of the Industrial Revolution (c.1750-1850) <br>
	and the discovery of the germ theory of disease in the second half of the nineteenth century,<br> 
	hygiene and sanitation have been at the forefront of the struggle against illness and disease.</br>
	<br></br>
	<br></br>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *4000 BC –</h2> 
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">Egyptian women apply galena mesdemet (made of copper and lead ore) <br>
	and malachite to their faces for color and definition.<br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *3000 BC – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">The Ancient Romans invented lead-lined water pipes and tanks. <br>
	The rich paid private water companies for their drinking water and other water needs, <br>
	although it wasn’t much better than the water supply the peasants used. <br>
	Most water systems where made from elm trunks and domestic pipes lined with lead.<br>
	Water was stored in large lead tanks and often became stagnant.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *2800 BC – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">Some of the earliest signs of soap or soap-like products were found<br>
	in clay cylinders during the excavation of ancient Babylon.<br>
	Inscriptions on the side of the cylinders say that fats were boiled with ashes,<br>
	but did not refer to the purpose of ‘soap’.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1550-1200 BC – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">The Ancient Israelites took a keen interest in hygiene. <br>
	Moses gave the Israelites detailed laws governing personal cleanliness. <br>
	He also related cleanliness to health and religious purification. <br>
	Biblical accounts suggest that the Israelites knew that mixing ashes and oil produced a kind of hair gel.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1500 BC – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">Records show that ancient Egyptians bathed regularly. <br>
	The Ebers Papyrus, a medical document from about 1500 B.C <br>
	describes combining animal and vegetable oils with alkaline salts<br>
	to form a soap-like material used for treating skin diseases, as well as for washing.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1200-200 BC – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">The ancient Greeks bathed for aesthetic reasons and apparently did not use soap.<br> 
	Instead, they cleaned their bodies with blocks of clay, sand, pumice and ashes, <br>
	then anointed themselves with oil, and scraped off the oil and dirt with a metal instrument known as a strigil. <br>
	They also used oil with ashes.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1000 BC - </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">Grecians whitened their complexion with chalk or lead face powder and fashioned crude lipstick out of ochre clays laced with red iron.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *600 BC – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">Ancient Greeks start using public baths.<br>
	 In “The Book of the Bath”, Françoise de Bonneville wrote, <br>
	“The history of public baths begins in Greece in the sixth century BC” where men and women washed in basins near places of exercise.<br>
	 The Ancient Greeks also start using chamber pots. <br>
	Used from at least 600 BC by ancient Grecians, they’ve been used up till around the 18th century all over the world.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *300 BC – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">Wealthy Ancient Romans began to use wiping techniques in their toilet habits. <br>
	Common materials used were wool and rosewater. About 100 years later, the more common Romans used a sponge soaked in salt water.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *19 BC – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">Ancient Romans began to use public baths.<br>
	 Agrippa (Emperor Augustus’ right-hand man) built the first public baths called Thermae in the year 19 BC. <br>
	They increased in number rapidly; at least 170 were operating in Rome by the year 33 BC, <br>
	with more than 800 operating at the height of their popularity.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *27 BC – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">Ancient Romans believed in the ability of urine to remove stains. <br>
	Until the medieval period, people used lye, made of ashes and urine, to clean their clothes.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *100 AD – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">The Ancient Romans developed cesspits, usually in the cellar or garden.<br>
	In 1183 BC a Roman Emperor’s hall floor collapsed, sending dinner guests into the cesspit where some of them, unfortunately, drowned.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *400 AD – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">In Medieval Britain, the population had begun various habits to keep their teeth clean. <br>
	This included rinsing your mouth out with water, or a mixture of vinegar and mint, to remove gunk.<br>
	Bay leaves soaked in orange flower water were also used, and the teeth would often be rubbed with a clean cloth too.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1110 AD – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">In Britain, one pamphlet recommended that people keep their teeth white by rubbing<br>
	their teeth with powdered fish bones and then rinsing their mouths out with a mixture of vinegar and sulphuric acid!.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1308 AD – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">In Britain it was common for your barber to remove problem teeth!<br>
	 If basic treatments didn’t fix the problem, the barber would be removing it, without the help of novocaine!<br>
	A guide for Barbers was established in 1308 teaching barber’s surgery skills.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1346-1353 AD – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">Black Death pandemic swept across Europe killing 40-50% of the population during a 4-year period. <br>
	Likely originating in Central Asia, it was probably spread through trade routes.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1400 AD – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">The Chinese invented toilet paper.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1500-1600 AD – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">Pale faces were fashionable during the reign of Elizabeth I. Ceruse<br>
	was the foundation make-up choice for both men and women in the Elizabethan era, as it gave them a smooth, pale look. <br>
	However, it contained lead that seeped into the body through the skin, leading to poisoning.<br>
	Variants with lead have, been used for thousands of years.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1566 – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">King James VI of Scotland wore the same clothes for months on end,<br>
	even sleeping in them on occasion. He also kept the same hat on 24 hours a day until it fell apart!<br>
	He didn’t take a bath as he thought it was bad for his health!</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1586– </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">Sir John Harington invented a valve that when pulled would release water from a water closet.<br>
	Albert Giblin holds the 1819 British Patent for the Silent Valveless Water Waste Preventer, a system that allowed a toilet to flush effectively.<br>
	Unfortunately, there were no Sewers or running water at the time, so it wasn’t able to be practically used.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1600 – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">New developments in teeth cleaning started to appear in Britain. <br>
	Rubbing one’s teeth with the ashes of rosemary was common, and powdered sage was used to rub on teeth as a whitening agent.<br>
	Vinegar and wine were also mixed to form a mouthwash.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1600-1700 – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">The same practices for cleaning were in use, but the ‘barbers’ (a.k.a dentists) <br>
	had begun to learn more about dentistry. The first dentures, gold crowns<br>
	, and porcelain teeth arrived in the 1700s. 1790 brought about the dental foot engine which rotated a drill for cleaning out cavities. <br>
	The first dental chair was made in the late 1700’s.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1600 – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">New developments in teeth cleaning started to appear in Britain.<br>
	Rubbing one’s teeth with the ashes of rosemary was common, and powdered sage was used to rub on teeth as a whitening agent.<br>
	Vinegar and wine were also mixed to form a mouthwash.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1750 – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">A letter from Lord Chesterfield to his son urges the use of a sponge and warm water to scrub the teeth each morning. <br>
	The recommendation of using one’s own urine in France was widely flouted by Fouchard, the French dentist.<br>
	Gunpowder and alum were also recommended.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1789 – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">People were already fashion-conscious during the 18th century.<br>
	When their eyebrows did not look fashionable,<br>
	they often masked them with tiny pieces of skin from a mouse. Poems from as early as 1718 insinuated their use.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1834 – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">The 1834 London Medical and Surgical Journal describes sharp stomach pains in patients with no evidence of disease. <br>
	This led them to believe “painter’s colic” was a “nervous affection” of the intestines occurring when lead “is absorbed into the body”.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1846 – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">Public baths had been popular since the 13th century. Due to the scarcity of firewood, bathing became an expensive practice<br>.
	  Whole families and friends had to share a bath, or many of them would remain dirty.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1847 – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">A physician called Ignaz Semmelwis found childbed fever occurred in women who were assisted by medical students.<br> 
	He found students who assisted in childbirth did so after autopsies. <br>
	After instituting a strict hand washing policy, deaths dropped by 20-fold within 3 months.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1837 – 1901 –</h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;"> A nose-gay was typically a small bouquet of flowers or a sachet of herbs. <br>
	It was attached to the wrist on a lapel or simply held in the hand.<br>
	It would also be held under one’s nose for people walking through crowds.<br>
	Nose-gays gained popularity during Queen Victoria’s reign.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1854 – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">In mid-18th century England, outbreaks of cholera led to an epidemic.<br>
	A physician called John Snow observed that cholera seemed to spread via sewage-contaminated water. <br>
	This was mostly noticed around a water pump in Broad Street, London. <br>
	John removed the pump handle and the spread was instantly contained.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1858 – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">Hot weather struck the capital in 1858, drying up the River Thames<br>
	and leaving pure sewage and other wasted piled up and exposed.<br>
	This was the start of ‘The Great Stink’, forcing Parliament to close for the day and <br>
	eventually initiating a reform of the sewerage systems and cesspits.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1861 – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">The modern flushing toilet. Thomas Crapper didn’t invent the flush toilet,<br>
	but is understood to have made major contributions towards its development by implanting a modern septic system that pumped soiled waters out of the city. <br>
	However, this particular subject is still heavily debated.</br></h2>
	<h2 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style"> *1920 – </h2>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Engravers MT;">Lysol was sold as a genital disinfectant and birth control method. <br>
	Lysol ads proclaimed a host of benefits for every gynecological need, and was the leading form of birth control from 1930 to 1960.<br>
	Lysol is actually a caustic poison causing burns and itches after the first drop – most women were applying it to their skin for 30 years.</br></h2>

	<h3 style="font-size:40pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Times New Roman"> Importance of Hygiene
 <p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:lft;font-style:Times New Roman"> Health Reasons</p></h3>

	
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Times New Roman;">
	Poor cleanliness causes sickness. On the off chance that you have cut yourself, the injury must be cleaned and dressed properly.<br>
	Care must be taken that the wound does not get infected due to external harmful bacteria.<br>
	It is very true that if you maintain good personal hygiene, you can minimize infections and health problems.</p>

<h3 style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Times New Roman"> Social Reasons</h3>
 <p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Times New Roman"> We all hate to be talked about, at least a majority of us,<br>
 particularly in a negative way. By making sure that our body is well represented and neat,<br>
 we represent ourselves in a positive way, thus reflecting a decent personality.<br>
Youngsters ought to be educated about the significance of cleanliness and how to accomplish<br>
 good hygiene right on time to keep themselves as well as other people sound and to diminish <br>
 the danger of being mocked at school or college.</p></h3></br>
