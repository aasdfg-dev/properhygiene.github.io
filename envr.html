	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	<br></br>
	We are living in a world where environmental pollution has become part of life. <br>
	Civilized humans today must live in cramped urban areas, drink contaminated water, take in polluted air, eat contaminated foods, and endure loud, disturbing noises.<br>
	Global warming, acid rain, holes in the ozone layer, deafening city noise, and contaminated water, food, and air have all degraded the quality of life and caused many health problems.<br>
	</br>
	Germs are everywhere and are introduced into school settings in a variety of ways e.g. on people, food, and pets. <br>
	Germs can survive on environmental surfaces for long periods.<br>
	Viruses, in particular, can be shed in large numbers in respiratory secretions and in feces and can survive on surfaces for days, or in the case of certain viruses such as norovirus, for weeks. <br>
	Environmental hygiene is therefore a vital part of good infection prevention and control.<br>
	</br>

	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	A thorough environmental hygiene is necessary and important for the prevention of transmission of the different infectious diseases within healthcare settings and in our whole environment.<br>
	This encompasses effective cleaning of different surfaces using the right process of cleaning, right products to use, decontamination of different equipment and devices used in our everyday life.<br>
	</br></br></br></center>
	
	<h1 style="font-size:25pt;text-align:center;font-style:Algerian ;color:black">Microorganisms collect on hospital environment surfaces and are spread</h1>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	In the past, experts believed that the most significant source of hospital-acquired pathogens was the patient's own endogenous flora; however, Weber, et al. (2010),<br>
	point out that an estimated 20 percent to 40 percent of nosocomial infections have been attributed to cross-infection via the hands of healthcare workers.<br>
	They add that this hand contamination could in turn result from either direct patient contact or indirectly from touching contaminated environmental surfaces.<br> 
	They also acknowledge that less commonly, a patient could become colonized with a nosocomial pathogen by direct contact with a contaminated environmental surface -- they say that in some cases,<br> 
	the extent of patient-to-patient transmission has been found to be directly proportional to the level of environmental contamination. <br>
	</br></br></br></center>
	
	<h1 style="font-size:25pt;text-align:center;font-style:Algerian ;color:black">Acquisition of specific organisms is impacted by environmental cleaning</h1>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	Wilson, et al. (2006) found that enhanced cleaning reduced environmental contamination and hand carriage, but no significant effect was observed on patient acquisition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus.<br> 
	Hayden, et al. (2006) found that decreasing environmental contamination may help to control the spread of some antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospitals, specifically vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).<br>
	</br>
	
	<center><img src="g1.png" width="350px" height="250px"></center>
	
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	Higher-level cleaning can be effective in removing MRSA from a range of environmental sites that are high risk of patient and/or healthcare worker hand contact in critical areas, such as ICUs.<br>
	However, in the absence of any residual cleaning and/or disinfectant effects, the clear beneficial effects of such decontamination interventions are transient and rapidly negated by subsequent failures in infection control practice.<br>
	These findings highlight the need for further work on detergent and disinfectant materials that have long lasting biocidal effects (Mamoon, 2009).<br>
	</br></br></br>
	
		<h1 style="font-size:25pt;text-align:center;font-style:Algerian ;color:black">Environmental contamination might lead to infection</h1>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	In order for environmental contamination to play an important role in the acquisition of a nosocomial pathogen, <br>
	the pathogen must demonstrate certain microbiologic characteristics: pathogen able to survive for prolonged periods of time on environmental surfaces;<br> 
	ability to remain virulent after environmental exposure; contamination of the hospital environment frequent; ability to colonize patients (Acinetobacter, C difficile, MRSA, VRE);<br>
	ability to transiently colonize the hands of healthcare workers; transmission via the contaminated hands of healthcare workers; small inoculating dose; and relative resistance to disinfectants used on environmental surfaces (Weber, 2010).<br>
	</br></center>

	<h1 style="font-size:25pt;text-align:center;font-style:Algerian ;color:black">Cleaning is essential</h1>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	Dancer (2009) issued a clarion call when she observed that until cleaning becomes an evidence-based science, with established methods for assessment, the importance of a clean environment is likely to remain speculative.<br>
	In her review, she examined the links between the hospital environment and persistent pathogens, noted their vulnerability to the cleaning and disinfection process, and established the potential for impact on patient infection rates when high-touch surfaces were addressed.<br>
	She also suggested that using proposed standards for hospital hygiene could provide further evidence that cleaning is a cost-effective intervention for controlling healthcare-associated infection.<br>
	<br>
	Role of surface contamination in transmission of healthcare-associated pathogens is an important issue because transmission can be interrupted by appropriate hand hygiene and cleaning/disinfection of environmental surfaces (Weber, 2010).<br>
	Cleaning is the removal of soil and contaminants from surfaces, whereas disinfection relates to the inactivation of pathogens by use of a disinfectant. <br>
	Microorganisms vary in their resistance to disinfectants, so agents must be chosen carefully for their effectiveness, particularly for C. difficile spores.<br>
	Furthermore, the hospital environment is complex and often difficult to clean, and use of a cleaning agent that is not effective against the target organism can spread pathogens to other surfaces.<br>
	Cleaning and disinfection does not always eradicate pathogens from surfaces, and it is difficult to determine whether it is the products, the procedures, or a combination of the two that is responsible for the failure to eradicate pathogens from surfaces (Otter, 2011).<br>

	<h1 style="font-size:25pt;text-align:left;font-style:Algerian ;color:black">DISINFECTION</h1>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:left;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
		Disinfection refers to process of removing many or all microorganisms that can cause disease, except bacterial spores. <br>
		There are three levels of disinfection, depending on how many organisms are removed: high, intermediate, and low. <br>
		A disinfectant is a chemical or a physical agent (e.g. ultraviolet radiation) that kills microorganisms, but not bacterial spores.  <br>
		Disinfectants are also classified as high-level, intermediate-level, and low-level.  <br>
	<br>
		The routine use of chemical disinfectants for environmental hygiene is not recommended as thorough regular cleaning with detergent and warm water is sufficient for most situations. <br>
		A disinfectant is recommended however, in circumstances where there is a higher risk of cross-infection or if there has been a spillage of blood, feces or vomit.<br>
		Disinfectants are potentially hazardous and must be used with caution and according to the manufacturer’s instructions.<br>

	<h1 style="font-size:25pt;text-align:left;font-style:Algerian ;color:black">Toilets and Wash Hand Basins and Showers </h1>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	Inadequate and inaccessible toilet facilities have been found to result in the community people drinking less in order to avoid using the toilet.<br>
	This results in dehydration, headaches, constipation, fatigue and poor concentration. <br>
	Toilets that are locked or remote may not be cleaned regularly.<br>
	<br></p>
	
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:left;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	*School toilets should be clean and in good repair and monitored regularly.  <br>
	*All toilet areas should have hand washing facilities including hot and cold running water.<br>
	*Toilets, wash hand basins and surrounding areas should be cleaned at least daily and whenever there is visible soiling.<br>  
	*Toilets should be cleaned thoroughly using a general purpose detergent paying particular attention to frequently touched areas such as toilet flush handles, toilet seats, basins and taps, and toilet door handles.<br>
	*Cream cleansers are suitable to use on ceramics e.g. wash hand basins and showers.<br>
	*Separate cloths should be used for cleaning the toilet and wash hand basin to reduce the risk of spreading germs from the toilet to the wash hand basin.<br>
	*A checklist should be located in the toilets which is dated and signed at regular intervals.<br>
	*Showers can act as a potential source of cross infection if they are not cleaned after use. Infections that are known to spread in showers include verruca (Figure 5) and athlete’s foot (fungal). <br>
	*Shower heads need regular cleaning to prevent scaling and a build-up of dirt which will impede flow.<br>
	*Water fountains and other drinking outlets should not be located in the toilets.<br>

	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	*Rinsing instructions for products, if required e.g. used on hard surfaces or objects which patients may put in their mouth, or touch mucous membranes.<br>
	*Specific instructions for in-use dilution of dilutable products.<br>
	*Do not mix different types of cleaning or disinfecting products (unless specified by the manufacturer) as the chemicals may react with each other.<br>
	*Keep equipment well maintained and in good repair. Observe cleaning equipment and environmental surfaces for cracks, breakdown, wear, and damage and take damaged equipment out of service. <br>
	*Store equipment in a manner that maintains cleanliness and prevents cross contamination (e.g. store clean and soiled equipment separately).<br>

	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	Plastic bags are commonly known as festal. They are widely used to carry goods from market to home in all areas because they are convenient, cheap and easy to use.<br> 
	Plastic bags are usually non-biodegradable and persist in the environment for a very long time. Moreover, when discarded indiscriminately, they pollute the land surface of your community,<br>
	prevent rainwater from percolating into the soil, can easily be blown all over the place by wind, and create unsightly and nuisance conditions. <br>
	The bags can also be easily swallowed by animals, which may block their digestive system and kill them.<br>
