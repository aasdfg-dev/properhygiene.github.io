<h1 style="font-size:40pt;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style;color:black">Clothes Hygiene</h1>
<br><br></br></br>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	Clothes hygiene is an important aspect of one’s dignity.<br>
	Changing used clothes for clean ones every day is recommended.<br>
	Washing dirty clothes requires adequate clean water, detergents (solid or powdered soap) and washing facilities.<br>
	If possible, the washed clothes should be ironed to help the destruction of body lice and nits. <br>
	Boiling water or insecticides can be used to destroy clothes infestation.<br>
	</br>
	Frequent changing into clean clothes might not always be possible in poor households.<br>
	However, the frequency of changing is advised to be twice a week for internal wear and 12 times per week for outerwear. <br>
	The frequency mainly depends on the intensity of dirt on the clothes, and that depends on the climate and type of activity.<br>
	</br>
	We usually have two layers of clothing.<br>
	The internal layer is underwear (or underclothes) such as pants, vest and T-shirt.<br>
	These are right next to our skin and collect sweat and dead skin cells,<br>
	which can stain the cloth. Bacteria love to grow on this dirt and produce a bad smell in addition to the specific odour of the sweat.<br>
	Underwear must be washed more frequently than the outer layer of clothing.<br>
	</br>
	The reality of adulthood is that we don't always eat our vegetables, <br>
	don't always brush our teeth,<br>
	and most of us wear clothes more than once before washing them. <br>
	Just because we've lived more years of life doesn't mean we're suddenly Martha Stewart,<br>
	or that we don't need to cut some corners every once in a while.<br>
	</br>
	And when it comes to our clothes, not washing them after every single use can actually be a good thing. <br>
	A piece on ways to ensure long life for our clothing specifically sited over washing as one of the biggest factors in wear and tear.<br>
	We're often being kinder to our clothes (and therefor our wallets) when we launder them as little as possible.<br>
	</br>
	The question then becomes: how do we achieve this without also feeling totally gross? <br>
	Because the fact of the matter is, we're only human, and humans sweat, and yes, smell.<br> 
	It's natural, albeit annoying. <br>
	And while most of us love the idea of saving time and — in the long run — money by preserving our clothes,<br>
	we also don't want to walk around being that person who obviously doesn't wash enough.<br>
	</br>
	The good news is, there are legitimately some great and super simple hygiene tips that allow us to wear clothes more than once without things getting gross.<br> 
	It's often just about a few easy maintenance routines and knowing a some definite "don'ts." <br>
	So for your convenience, here are nine hygiene tips everyone who wears clothes more than once should know.<br>
	</br></center></p>
	<br></br>

	<h1 style="font-size20pt;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style;color:black">1. Do The "Sniff Test"</h1><br>
	<center><img src="men.jpg" width="200px" height="250px"></br></center>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	If you're one of those people who gets freaked out wearing clothes that don't smell like they were freshly laundered,<br> 
	it might be time to reframe your perspective a little. According to a piece on the lifestyle site SnappyLiving,<br>
	it's natural for clothes to take on the scents of our body, whether it be the lotion we wear, or body oils.<br>
	So just because our clothes don't smell like detergent anymore doesn't mean they actually smell bad. <br>
	Wait until they actually begin to smell like sweat or B.O. to throw them in the hamper.<br>
	</br></center></p>
	
	<h1 style="font-size20pt;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style;color:black">2. Apply Anti-Perspirant At Night</h1><br>
	<center><img src="deo.png" width="200px" height="250px"></br></center>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	According to Consumer Report, antiperspirant is most effective when applied at night after a shower.<br>
	This enables the product to really absorb into your skin and fight sweat for the next 24 hours.<br>
	Use deodorant (as opposed to anti-perspirant which is actively designed to stop sweating) for touch ups in the morning or throughout the day.<br>
	</br></center></p>
	
	<h1 style="font-size20pt;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style;color:black">3. Shave Regularly</h1><br>
	<center><img src="shave.png" width="200px" height="250px"></br></center>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	A piece for Cosmopolitan noted that body hair can trap sweat, which can foster bacteria growth and therefor odors. <br>
	If you're someone who re-wears clothes before washing, shaving regularly is a good way to keep things fresher longer.<br>
	Plus, it helps keep you cool in the summer — and who doesn't like that?<br>
	</br></center></p>
	
	<h1 style="font-size20pt;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style;color:black">4. Invest In Some Linen Spray</h1><br>
	<center><img src="linen.png" width="200px" height="250px"></br></center>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	OK, this one isn't technically a hygiene tip because it doesn't kill bacteria.<br>
	However, it does help you feel super fresh if you're one of those people who loves your clothes to smell like they've just been laundered even when they haven't. <br>
	Just spray directly on your clothes to keep them smelling fresh.<br>
	</br></center></p>
	
	<h1 style="font-size20pt;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style;color:black">5. Hang Clothes In The Sun</h1><br>
	<center><img src="sun.jpg" width="400px" height="250px"></br></center>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	According to Outside Online, a site devoted to active lifestyles, <br>
	studies have shown that hanging your clothes in the sun kills some bacteria,<br>
	and noted it even works best on dry clothes. Try keeping a drying rack in your home by a window that gets a lot of natural light,<br>
	and hang clothes there when you come home each day. <br>
	Return them to your closet after they've spend a day soaking up some sun.<br>
	</br></center></p>
	
	<h1 style="font-size20pt;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style;color:black">6. Don't Leave Workout Clothes In A Gym Back</h1><br>
	<center><img src="gym.png" width="300px" height="250px"></br></center>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	Most of us end up wearing our gym clothes more than once, and that's totally okay. <br>
	However, a compilation piece on gym clothes maintenance noted the importance of not keeping your clothes in your gym bag overnight.<br>
	The combination of the moisture from our sweat and the dark environment is a recipe for mold and bacteria growth.<br>
	Instead, always make sure you remove your clothes after a workout and let them air out.<br>
	This will definitely extend how many times you can get away with wearing them before washing.<br>
	</br></center></p>
	
	<h1 style="font-size20pt;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style;color:black">7. Invest In Sweat Absorbing Workout Clothes</h1><br>
	<center><img src="dress.png" width="200px" height="250px"></br></center>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	Here's another workout clothes tip: invest in brands that are specifically designed to absorb odors.<br>
	They might seem pricier up front, but I promise you'll notice a difference right away in how long you can wear an item before it needs washing.<br>
	I've found that regular cotton T-shirts and spandex just can't compete.<br>
	</br></center></p>
	
	<h1 style="font-size20pt;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style;color:black">8. Socks Don't Apply</h1><br>
	<center><img src="socks.jpg" width="400px" height="250px"></br></center>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	So odds are you already knew that underwear doesn't apply when it comes to wearing things more than once, and sadly, socks don't either.<br>
	I've been doing a lot of reading about tip for re-wearing clothes, and all across the board socks are in the "single use" category.<br>
	Your dark shoes, often damp with sweat, provide the perfect environment for bacteria to grow,<br>
	meaning your socks should go straight in the hamper.<br>
	</br></center></p>
	
	<h1 style="font-size20pt;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style;color:black">9. Wash Your Body Regularly</h1><br>
	<center><img src="sink.jpg" width="400px" height="250px"></br></center>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	OK, this one probably seems super obvious, but it's definitely worth mentioning.<br>
	One of the best ways to ensure your clothes don't smell is by making sure your body is clean and fresh,<br> 
	since your clothes are really just absorbing your scent. Shower everyday, even if you don't wash you hair,<br>
	and make sure you get in the nooks an crannies that allow bacteria to multiply,<br>
	like under your arms and between your toes.<br>
	<br></br>
	<br></br>
	Wearing clothes more than once is sometimes a necessity, but it doesn't have to make you feel gross.<br>
	Incorporate the above tips into your routine, and say hello to fresher clothes and less laundry!<br>
