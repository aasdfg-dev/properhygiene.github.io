	Poor personal hygiene can result in increased risk of infection and illnesses,<br>
	consequently creating many social problems.<br>
	Each individual has different hygiene practices.<br>
	As such, nurses need to identify the hygiene practices of their patients and what sort of assistance needs to be offered,<br>
	 as this will help them to organise patient care appropriately.<br>  
	Social practices from childhood till adulthood, an individual’s hygiene practice could remain the same, <br>
	or change in accordance with their social environment. <br>
	The main social factors that influence hygiene practice are who the patients are living and socialising with.<br>
	</br></br></br>
	
	<h1 style="font-size:20pt;text-align:left;font-style:Algerian ;color:black">Definition:</h1>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	The word hygiene refers to 'the science of health and its maintenance, the prevention of disease, and sanitary practices'.</center></p>
	
		<h1 style="font-size:20pt;text-align:left;font-style:Algerian ;color:black">Personal Hygiene </h1>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	 is the activity of self-care, including bathing and grooming. Care of the skin, hair, nails, mouth, teeth, eyes, ears, nasal cavities, and perineal and genital areas.</center></p>
	<br></br>
	
		<h1 style="font-size:20pt;text-align:center;font-style:Algerian ;color:black">Factors influencing personal hygiene practices </h1>
		<h1 style="font-size:20pt;text-align:center;font-style:Algerian ;color:black">Development level :</h1>
		<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
		Children learn most of their hygiene practices at home and in their personal environment.<br>
		They modify their behaviour with other family members.<br>
		Many of these behaviours stick with them throughout life.<br> 
		The advancing age, hormonal levels and changes in the integumentary system often require hygienic practices.<br></br>
	
	<h1 style="font-size:20pt;text-align:center;font-style:Algerian ;color:black">Cultural background and  Cultural variations</h1>
		<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	An individual’s hygiene practice is also influenced by culture.As such,<br>
	self-care practices align closely with their cultural beliefs.<br>
	So even if a patient’s hygienic practice differs from that of the nurse<br>
	(due to such a reason), it is important to not express disapproval,<br>
	but instead maintain a professional demeanour.<br>
	</br></br>
	Norms related to hygiene practices differ from culture to culture. <br>
	For example, North American culture places a high value on personal cleanliness<br>
	and people have a habit of bathing daily where as people from other culture<br>
	mayor may not consider bathing as a daily practice.<br>
	</br></br>
 
	<h1 style="font-size:20pt;text-align:center;font-style:Algerian ;color:black">Socio economic status:</h1>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	Financial status often affects a person' s ability to purchase hygiene products.<br>
	If nurses work within rural areas, they will see dishevelled-looking patients who commonly<br>
	neglect their hygiene due to their lack of financial resources.<br>
	To help these patients to develop good hygienic practices, they must also bear in mind that they will require cheaper products when it comes to toiletries and such, and refrain from recommending expensive products to them. <br>
	</br>
	<h1 style="font-size:20pt;text-align:center;font-style:Algerian ;color:black">Religion:</h1>
	<p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	Some religions observe specific rules related to personal hygiene<br></br>
	
	<h1 style="font-size:20pt;text-align:left;font-style:Algerian ;color:black"> Health status:</h1>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	Persons who are ill are often unable to attend to personal hygienic activities,<br>
	either because they have a low energy supply or a specific physical deficit.<br>
	</br>
	
	<h1 style="font-size:20pt;text-align:center;font-style:Algerian ;color:black"> Body image/physical condition:</h1>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	Like most cases in hospitals, nurses would have noticed that patients with <br>
	altered body image and impaired physical condition will have difficulties in performing hygiene practices. <br>
	The limitations and disabilities that they have restrict them<br>
	from personally taking charge of proper hygienic care.<br>
	</br>
	In the orthopedic ward, a patient in traction or cast who has limited range of movement <br>
	will definitely be needing assistance for hygiene. Anyone suffering from arthritis or<br>
	other mobility affecting conditions may have difficulties in bathing.<br>
	This is similar with patients who have just undergone medical surgery and do not have<br>
	the mental clarity or coordination to perform self-care due to the effects of sedation.<br>
	A Parkinson disease patient would probably have difficulty in holding the toothbrush,<br>
	comb, which impaired their ability to perform daily hygiene routine.<br>
	</br>
	
	<h1 style="font-size:20pt;text-align:center;font-style:Algerian ;color:black">Parents</h1>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	are a major influence on their children’s hygienic practices.<br> 
	This is especially so when it comes to the frequency of bathing, <br>
	oral care and the timing of the bath.<br>
	When the childs enters adolescence, their personal hygiene habits<br>
	may change as they start to socialise<br>
	more with peers, e.g. starting to prioritise skin care and cosmetics.<br>
	However, it should be noted that if poor hygiene practices <br
	during childhood were too deeply conditioned,<br>
	this would likely have a negative social effect for the child,<br>
	who would then have less opportunity to learn<br>
	and form new habits instead. <br>
	<br>
	All the above affects the patient when entering adulthood - involvement with coworkers and friends<br>
	may develop to be more mature, but as above, some childhood habits that are too deeply ingrained<br>
	may refrain new ones from emerging. <br>
	If a nurse sees that social issues or total unawareness of the issue<br>
	are at the root of poor hygience practices,<br>
	they will need to handle these accordingly either by being direct or<br>
	calling in a professional, depending on the situation.<br>
	</br>
	
	<h1 style="font-size:20pt;text-align:center;font-style:Algerian ;color:black">Personal preference</h1>
	<center><p style="font-size:20pt;font-color:black;text-align:center;font-style:Goudy Old Style">
	While a patient’s hygiene practices could change with their social environment,<br>
	patients who have their own stand about hygiene<br>
	would maintain their personal care preferences. <br>
	For example, they may have preferences in using certain care products in shaving,<br>
	bathing and washing hair. Some would prefer to wash their hair once a day; <br>
	others may prefer to use hair care products to substitute shampoo instead.<br>
	<br>
	Different individuals have different personal hygiene preferences.<br>
	For that reason, assessing patient’s personal preferences is a <br>
	vital step to providing proper care.<br>
	<br>
	This can be done by carefully observing their routine hygiene practices and the health care products used.<br>
	Otherwise, prior to performing any procedures, nurses can ask them in detail <br>
	about their preferred hygiene practices when they are uncertain about their preferences.<br>
	</br>
	Hygiene practices such as bathing, perineal hygiene and hair care practices can be a sensitive topic for some. Nurses who provide care to patients should take note of their preferred hygiene practices, so that they will be able to develop a suitable care plan in accordance with these. MIMS<br>
